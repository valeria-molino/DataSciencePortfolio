Data Science Portfolio | Exploring human behavior and well-being through data, machine learning, and visual deep learning.

# 🌍 The Data of Happiness

*A data science portfolio exploring global well-being, inequality, and the many dimensions of happiness through data.*

---

## 🎯 Overview

This portfolio is a collection of projects that combine mathematics, data science, and storytelling to explore **what defines human well-being** — from economic growth to health, education, and perception.

Each project is self-contained, using real-world data and reproducible analysis, moving from **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to **Machine Learning**, **Bayesian inference**, and **Deep Learning**.
